# PyQGIS scripts

This is a collection of PyQGIS scripts that I write for different purposes. 
The following scripts are available (under a GNU GPL v.2.0 license):

 * Iterate through features: [iterate_features.py](https://github.com/gacarrillor/pyqgis_scripts/blob/master/iterate_features.py)
 
   See http://gis.stackexchange.com/q/133189/4972 for instructions.

 * Iterate through layers and export map as PNG: [iterate_layers_export_png.py](https://github.com/gacarrillor/pyqgis_scripts/blob/master/iterate_layers_export_png.py)
 
   See http://gis.stackexchange.com/a/189825/4972 for instructions.

 * Snap a road network to a hexgrid: [snap_road_network_to_hexgrid.py](https://github.com/gacarrillor/pyqgis_scripts/blob/master/snap_road_network_to_hexgrid.py)
 
   See http://gis.stackexchange.com/a/189731/4972 for instructions.
